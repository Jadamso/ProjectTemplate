  abstract = {This paper challenges the long-standing belief that changes
        in patterns of war and war making caused the emergence of large
        territorial states. Using new data describing the universe of European
        states between 1100 and 1790, I find that small political units
        continued to thrive well into the ``age of the territorial state.'' Some
        scholars have argued that changes in the production of violence led to
        the dominance of geographically large political units during this era.
        In contrast, I find evidence that variation in patterns of economic
        development and urban growth caused fragmented political authority in
        some places and the construction of geographically large territorial
        states in others. Exploiting random climatic deviations in the
        propensity of certain geographical areas to support large populations,
        I show via an instrumental-variables approach that the emergence of
        towns and cities caused the formation of small and independent
        states.},

  abstract = { Abstract The hypothesis that democracies rarely fight each other is well-supported for the contemporary era. Yet evidence for it in another era of many democracies—Greece in the fifth century BCE—is weak at best. This article considers several reasons why the experience of the two eras may differ. It shows that the causal reasoning of the contemporary democratic peace depends on key assumptions about how institutions constrain leaders that did not apply well in ancient polities. Analysis of these differences helps to clarify theoretical understanding of interstate relations in both eras. }

 abstract = {The proposition that democracies rarely fight each other in the modern international system is increasingly accepted, and of great importance to theory and practice. Yet the reasons behind this phenomenon, and hence expectations as to how it may operate under other conditions, are still not well understood. This article systematically compiles information on wars and types of political systems in the world of ancient Greek city-states, and asks when and why democracies fought each other. A quantitative analysis of war-fighting patterns is inconclusive, but contextual examination of acts and perceptions as reported in ancient sources illuminates the motivations. Despite prominent exceptions, a norm against fighting other democracies was emerging and had some effect.},

 abstract = {This article challenges the findings of Russett & Antholis (1993) in two areas: First, the general picture they draw needs to be revised because the conflicting behaviour among the democracies of the Athenian Alliance is not representative of a zone of (democratic) peace. The relative absence of war between the democracies of the Delian League seems more to be the result of hegemonic Athens than an effect of shared democratic norms. The introduction of democratic polities in allied cities can be conceived as an effective means among others of dominating them, because without the support of Athens democratic elites were unable to retain power through the internal disturbances which were typical of the democracies outside Athens. Second, the clashes between Athens and Syracuse in 415-413 BC cannot be regarded as having been a war between stable democracies. Disrupted by internal violence, Syracuse could not have been perceived as a stable democracy by Athens. Since Athens is clearly identified as the aggressor in this conflict and information was sufficient between the two opponents, a social-constructivist approach appears to be superior to normative and structural approaches in this instance.},

Here we compile an original dataset measuring nine different types of nation-building policies. We first use logistic regressions to test the effect of nation-building policies on civil wars using two different datasets of civil wars, and find no evidence of a negative relationship between nation-building and civil war onset. Furthermore, a survival analysis exercise reveals a robust relationship between the proximity of nation-building policies and the onset of civil war. },

    abstract   = {In large-N investigations, civil conflicts -- like any
    significant political event -- tend to be studied and understood at the
    country level. Popular explanations of why and where civil wars occur,
    however, refer to such factors as ethnic discrimination, wealth inequalities,
    access to contrabands, and peripheral havens. The intensity of such factors
    varies geographically within states. Therefore, any statistical study of
    civil war that uses country-level approximations of local phenomena is
    potentially flawed. In this paper, we disaggregate the country and let 100 ×
    100 km grid cells be the units of observation. Having developed
    geo-referenced conflict data from Uppsala/PRIO's conflict database, we use
    \{GIS\} to identify regions of peace and conflict and as a tool to generate
    sub-national measures of key explanatory variables. The results from an
    empirical analysis of African civil wars, 1970--2001, demonstrate spatial
    clustering of conflict that co-varies with the spatial distribution of
    several exogenous factors. Territorial conflict is more likely in sparsely
    populated regions near the state border, at a distance from the capital, and
    without significant rough terrain. Conflict over state governance is more
    likely in regions that are densely populated, near diamond fields, and near
    the capital city. These promising findings show the value of the innovative
    research design and offer nuanced explanations of the correlates of civil
    war.},

Today, no study using TSCS data is published unless it manages to control for temporal dependence. Using Bremer's (1992) seminal “Dangerous Dyads” article as a starting point, this article has two ambitions. First, it seeks to explore whether the original results are replicable with new and updated data. Second, it aims to uncover whether Bremer's now unconventional choice of statistical model was decisive for his results. The analysis shows that despite clear evidence of serially correlated units, the alternative logit, GEE, and survival models yield relatively similar results. However, Bremer's finding of a monadic democratic peace is not robust to various operationalizations of democracy. His choice of democracy indicator thus seems to have had a significant influence on his conclusions, demonstrating that data selection can be as crucial as the choice of statistical model. },

    Abstract = {International relations scholars make frequent use of pooled cross-sectional regression in which N dyads over T time points are combined to create NT observations. Unless special conditions are met, these regressions produce biased estimates of regression coefficients and their standard errors. A survey of recent publications in international relations shows little attention to this issue. Using data from the period 1951-92, we examine the consequences of pooling for models of militarized disputes and bilateral trade. When pooled models are reestimated to allow for stable but unobserved differences among dyads, the results are altered in fundamental ways. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

                literature by applying meta-regression analysis to quantify the
                magnitude of strategic inter-jurisdictional expenditure
                interactions, controlling for study, and institutional
                characteristics. We find several robust results beyond
                confirming that jurisdictions do engage in strategic
                expenditure interactions, namely that strategic interactions:
                (i) are weakening over time, (ii) are stronger among
                municipalities than among higher levels of government, and
                (iii) appear to be more influenced from tax competition than
                yardstick competition, with capital controls and fiscal
                decentralization shaping the magnitude of fiscal
                interactions.},

                near other poorly governed countries, and well governed
                countries near other well governed countries. Researchers, by identifying
                country characteristics (e.g., ethnic fractionalization) that may influence
                government quality, have provided one potential explanation: Neighboring
                countries tend to be similar with respect to those characteristics.  In this
                paper, we draw on Hirschman's notion of “exit” as a disciplining device in
                order to provide a different, though complementary, explanation: The ability of
                a ruler to implement policy that displeases the country's populace is
                constrained by opportunities for residents to relocate to other countries
                nearby. To generate testable predictions about the effects of potential exit on
                government quality, we develop a simple theoretical model. We test the model's
                predictions using cross-sectional and panel data, controlling for other
                determinants of government quality. The evidence we present – which includes
                discussion of historical examples such as ancient Greece and the Soviet Bloc –

    a comprehensive list of diamond deposits accompanied by geographic coordinates

    such as production status and geological form of the deposit. Particularly
    important is the distinction between primary and secondary diamonds, because

    abstract   = {The debate on the waning of war has recently moved into higher
    gear. This forum contributes to that debate. Steven Pinker observes that a
    decline in war does not require a romantic theory of human nature. In fact, it
    is compatible with a hardheaded view of human violent inclinations, firmly
    rooted in evolutionary biology. Homo sapiens evolved with violent tendencies,
    but they are triggered by particular circumstances rather than a hydraulic urge
    that must periodically be discharged. And, although our species evolved with
    motives that can erupt in violence, it also evolved motives that can inhibit
    violence, including self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness, and open-ended
    cognitive mechanisms that can devise technologies for reducing violence.
    Bradley Thayer argues that the decline of war thesis is flawed because the
    positive forces identified by these authors do not rule outside of the West or
    even fully inside of it. Their analysis also neglects the systemic causes of
    conflict and its insights for increasingly intense security competition between
    China and the United States. Jack Levy and William Thompson question some of
    the theoretical arguments advanced to explain the historical pattern of
    declining violence. They argue that cultural and ideational explanations for
    the decline in interstate war underestimate the extent to which those factors
    are endogenous to material and institutional variables. Arguments about the
    pacifying effects of the rise of the state and of commerce fail to recognize
    that in some historical contexts, those factors have contributed to the
    escalation of warfare. The introduction to the symposium outlines briefly some
    of the major issues: nature versus nurture, the reliability of the data, how
    broadly violence should be defined, whether there is more agreement on the
    phenomenon than on its causes, and finally whether the future will be like the
    past.},

    security, the equilibrium market structure involves competing lords, a
    condition that leads to a tragedy of coercion: all the savings from the
    provision of collective protection are dissipated and welfare can be as low as,
    or even lower than, in the absence of the state. Thus, we explain the tendency
    towards autocracy both in history, before the appearance of modern
    representative governance, and in many low-income countries in modern times.},

    from sub-region to sub-region. Most puzzling is the difference between West
    Africa and the Horn of Africa. In the latter, border disputes are much more
    likely to escalate into war than in the former. Seeking to solve this puzzle,
    this study focuses on the territorial integrity norm. It departs from existing
    accounts of this norm in two ways: first, it does not choose the region but the
    sub-region as the level of analysis. Second, it does not isolate the
    territorial integrity norm from its social context but analyses the interplay
    of the norm with the social structure in which it is embedded. It concludes
    that the territorial integrity norm in West Africa is part of a social
    structure different from that in the Horn of Africa. It is this difference that
    explains the different patterns of conflict management in the two sub-regions.

    terrorism, one could easily think we live in the most violent age ever seen.
    Yet as New York Times bestselling author Steven Pinker shows in this startling
    and engaging new work, just the opposite is true: violence has been diminishing
    for millennia and we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species'
    existence. For most of history, war, slavery, infanticide, child abuse,
    assassinations, pogroms, gruesome punishments, deadly quarrels, and genocide
    were ordinary features of life. But today, Pinker shows (with the help of more
    than a hundred graphs and maps) all these forms of violence have dwindled and
    are widely condemned. How has this happened? This groundbreaking book continues
    Pinker's exploration of the essence of human nature, mixing psychology and
    history to provide a remarkable picture of an increasingly nonviolent world.
    The key, he explains, is to understand our intrinsic motives- the inner demons
    that incline us toward violence and the better angels that steer us away-and
    how changing circumstances have allowed our better angels to prevail. Exploding
    fatalist myths about humankind's inherent violence and the curse of modernity,
    this ambitious and provocative book is sure to be hotly debated in living rooms
    and the Pentagon alike, and will challenge and change the way we think about
    our society.},

The analysis finds evidence that the repressive behavior of both governments and rebel groups is linked to conflict geography. Governments violate physical integrity rights more frequently and kill more civilians the greater the overall amount of territory under contestation. Rebels kill more civilians in highly dispersed insurgencies that lack a clear epicenter. },

    surveys three sets of hypotheses put forward in the conflict literature
    regarding the relationship between the size and location of population groups.
    These hypotheses are based on population mass and concentrations, distances,
    and some residual state-level characteristics. The hypotheses are tested with a
    new dataset – \{ACLED\} (Armed Conflict Location and Events Dataset) – that
    disaggregates internal conflicts into individual events. The analysis covers 14
    countries in Central Africa. The conflict event data are juxtaposed with
    geographically disaggregated data on populations, distance to capitals,
    borders, and road networks. The paper develops a statistical method to analyze
    these types of data. The analysis shows that the risk of conflict events
    increases with local population size, and is particularly large in highly
    populous locations within a country. We find only a moderate difference in
    conflict-proneness between areas located close to or far from a country's
    capital, except when combined with population concentration: Conflict events
    cluster particularly strongly in larger population concentrations that are
    distant from the capital, such as the Eastern provinces of the Democratic

    organized violence with at least one fatality – comes with date, geographical

    violence, as well as some potential biases induced by the operationalizations.
    Thirdly, we provide an example of how the data can be used, by illustrating the
    association between cities and organized violence, taking population density
    into account. The UCDP GED is a useful resource for conflict analyses below the

    method for investigating and explaining human and state behavior while
    generating insights into the origins of human and animal warfare, ethnic
    conflict, and the influence of disease on international relations. Using
    ethnological and statistical studies of warfare among tribal societies, Thayer
    argues that humans wage war for reasons predicted by evolutionary theory -- to
    gain and protect vital resources but also for the physically and emotionally
    stimulating effects of combat. Thayer demonstrates that an evolutionary
    understanding of disease will become a more important part of the study of
    international relations as new strains of diseases emerge and advances in
    genetics make biological warfare a more effective weapon for states and
    terrorists. He also explains the deep causes of ethnic conflict by illuminating
    how xenophobia and ethnocentrism evolved in humans. He notes that these
    behaviors once contributed to our ancestors' success in radically different
    environments, but they remain a part of us. Darwin and International Relations
    makes a major contribution to our understanding of human history and the future

    literature on the relationship between territory and war. What is clear is that
    territory has been and will continue to be a core issue in explaining the
    escalation and onset of war and that territory has peculiar features that
    impact whether and how a conflict evolves and ends, and the nature of the peace
    that follows. These dynamics have received significant consideration
    theoretically and empirically. Although research initially centered on
    interstate wars, focus broadened to include intrastate or civil wars. On the
    methodological side, scholarship has taken a quantitative shift. The article
    concludes that both theorizing and empirical testing have become increasingly
    sophisticated.},

Our focus is on the interaction between the scarcity of resources and the incentives for war in the presence of limited commitment. We show that a key parameter determining the incentives for war is the elasticity of demand. Our first result identifies a novel externality that can precipitate war: price-taking firms fail to internalize the impact of their extraction on military action. In the case of inelastic resource demand, war incentives increase over time and war may become inevitable. Our second result shows that in some situations, regulation of prices and quantities by the resource-rich country can prevent war, and when this is the case, there will also be slower resource extraction than the Hotelling benchmark (with inelastic demand). Our third result is that because of limited commitment and its implications for armament incentives, regulation of prices and quantities might actually precipitate war even in some circumstances where wars would not have arisen under competitive markets.},

Arthur M. Eckstein challenges claims that Rome was an exceptionally warlike and aggressive state—not merely in modern but in ancient terms—by arguing that intense militarism and aggressiveness were common among all Mediterranean polities from ca 750 B.C. onwards.In his wide-ranging and masterful narrative, Eckstein explains that international politics in the ancient Mediterranean world was, in political science terms, a multipolar anarchy: international law was minimal, and states struggled desperately for power and survival by means of warfare. Eventually, one state, the Republic of Rome, managed to create predominance and a sort of peace. Rome was certainly a militarized and aggressive state, but it was successful not because it was exceptional in its ruthlessness, Eckstein convincingly argues; rather, it was successful because of its exceptional ability to manage a large network of foreign allies, and to assimilate numerous foreigners within the polity itself. This book shows how these characteristics, in turn, gave Rome incomparably large resources for the grim struggle of states fostered by the Mediterranean anarchy—and hence they were key to Rome's unprecedented success.},

It begins by developing a theoretical model to demonstrate how exogenous economic conditions can influence the incentives to establish democratic institutions. The model predicts that democratic institutions will expand where they mitigate important time‐inconsistency problems and, therefore, encourage investment. Exogenous conditions determine the magnitude of those time‐inconsistency problems and, hence, the likelihood of democracy. A comparison of ancient Greek city‐states suggests that the conditions under which democracy first emerged support the model. Other potential applications are discussed.},

    emphasizing the threat and despicable character of the rival country.  Wars

    claims to property is determined. The analysis focuses on the possibility of a
    nonaggressive equilibrium, in which no resources are allocated to offensive
    weapons and claims to property are fully secure. We also analyze the complex
    relation between economic welfare and the security of claims to property. We
    find, for example, that a relatively poor agent could be better off in an
    equilibrium with less secure claims to property.},

    Annexation, and Attempted Conquest. The theory shows how the choice among these
    strategies depends on such factors as the economic gains from imperial
    expansion, the relative effectiveness of imperial armies, the costs of
    projecting imperial military power, and liquidity constraints on financing
    imperial armies. This theory also addresses the scope of imperial ambitions.
    The paper uses examples from the history of the Roman, Mongol, Ottoman, and

In our model economic competition between rival rulers for the allegiance of subjects results in their subjects, whether they are producers or soldiers, receiving incomes equal to the value of the marginal product of a producer. Furthermore, abstracting from destruction, military competition for the control of land, to the extent that it shifts some subjects from producing to soldiering, increases the value of the marginal product of a producer. Consequently, as long as military competition is not too destructive, the subjects of rival rulers have higher incomes with both military and economic competition than with economic competition alone. Economic competition for the allegiance of subjects causes rival rulers to bear all of the cost of allocating production to military competition and to bear more than the cost of the foregone production of soldiers.},

    to several similarities between how democratic institutions affect both

    most prominent explanations as well as the most important objections raised to
    the finding, empirically and theoretically. To a large degree, the empirical
    finding that pairs of democratic states have a lower risk of interstate
    conflict than other pairs holds up, as does the conclusion that consolidated
    democracies have less conflict than semi-democracies. The most critical
    challenge to both conclusions is the position that both democracy and peace are
    due to pre-existing socio-economic conditions. I conclude that this objection
    has considerable leverage, but it also seems clear that economic development is
    unlikely to bring about lasting peace alone, without the formalization embedded

    at large. If there is no political bias, then there are mutually acceptable
    transfers from one country to the other that will avoid a war in the presence
    of commitment or enforceability of peace treaties. There are cases with a
    strong enough bias on the part of one or both countries where war cannot be
    prevented by any transfer payments. Our results shed some new light on the
    uneven contender paradox and the interpretation of the "democratic peace." We
    examine countries' choices of the bias of their leaders and show that when
    transfers are possible, at least one country will choose a biased leader, as
    that leads to a strong bargaining position and extraction of transfers. (JEL

    definitive formulation of economic efficiency, including the surplus approach
    to collective welfare; the technically flawed but nonetheless insightful
    treatment of path dependence in consumer theory; and the introduction of
    non-competitive market analysis to the general equilibrium economics. In so
    doing, Pareto's general study of economic equilibrium not only substantially
    extended the contributions to economic theory made by Léon Walras, his
    predecessor in the Chair of Political Economy at the University of Lausanne, it
    did so in a manner that was often contrary to Walras's own thinking on the
    formalisation of economic theory. . This English language 'critical edition' of
    Pareto's Manual of Political Economy-a revised and extended translation of
    the 'Edizione critica' published in Italian in 2006-is a very significant
    book for two main reasons. First, it is the only variorum translation of the
    Italian language Manuale di Economia Politica, originally published in 1906,
    and the subsequent French language Manuel d'Économie Politique, originally
    published in 1909. Second, it includes extensive contributions from the editors
    including annotations, to clarify particular points in Pareto's text; editors'
    notes, to critically reflect on major themes in Pareto's text and to draw
    attention to the historical influences that led to their development and their
    anticipation of, or influence on, subsequent ideas that emerged in economics;

    largest political entities of the ancient world, developing simultaneously yet
    independently at opposite ends of Eurasia. Although their territories
    constituted only a small percentage of the global land mass, these two Eurasian
    polities controlled up to half of the world population and endured longer than
    most pre-modern imperial states. Similarly, their eventual collapse occurred
    during the same time. 
        The parallel nature of the Qin/Han and Roman empires has rarely been studied
    comparatively. Yet here is a collection of pioneering case studies, compiled by
    Walter Scheidel, that sheds new light on the prominent aspects of imperial
    state formation. This essential new volume builds on the foundation of
    Scheidel's Rome and China (2009), and opens up a comparative dialogue among
    distinguished scholars. They provide unique insights into the complexities of
    imperial rule, including the relationship between rulers and elite groups, the
    funding of state agents, the determinants of urban development, and the rise of
    bureaucracies. By bringing together experts in each civilization, State Power

    abstract   = {This paper examines interaction in the absence of property rights when agents face a trade-off between productive and coercive activities. In this setting, conflict is not the necessary outcome of one-time interaction, and cooperation is consistent with domination of one agent over another. Other things being equal, an agent's power, a well-defined concept in this paper, is inversely related to an agent's resources when resources are valued according to marginal-productivity theory. Some implications for the evolution of property rights are drawn. The model is applicable to a variety of situations in which directly unproductive activities are prevalent.},

The estimated effect is larger for oilfields with higher-quality oil and lower exploration and extraction costs.

    face-to-face cooperation, to huge anonymous societies of today, typically
    organized as states? Why is there so much variation in the ability of different
    human populations to construct viable states? Existing theories are usually
    formulated as verbal models and, as a result, do not yield sharply defined,
    quantitative predictions that could be unambiguously tested with data. Here we
    develop a cultural evolutionary model that predicts where and when the
    largest-scale complex societies arose in human history. The central premise of
    the model, which we test, is that costly institutions that enabled large human
    groups to function without splitting up evolved as a result of intense
    competition between societies—primarily warfare. Warfare intensity, in turn,
    depended on the spread of historically attested military technologies (e.g.,
    chariots and cavalry) and on geographic factors (e.g., rugged landscape). The
    model was simulated within a realistic landscape of the Afroeurasian landmass
    and its predictions were tested against a large dataset documenting the
    spatiotemporal distribution of historical large-scale societies in Afroeurasia
    between 1,500 BCE and 1,500 CE. The model-predicted pattern of spread of
    large-scale societies was very similar to the observed one. Overall, the model
    explained 65\% of variance in the data. An alternative model, omitting the
    effect of diffusing military technologies, explained only 16\% of variance. Our
    results support theories that emphasize the role of institutions in
    state-building and suggest a possible explanation why a long history of
    statehood is positively correlated with political stability, institutional
    quality, and income per capita.},

    abstract   = {Modern economics has largely ignored the issue of outright
    conflict as an alternative way of allocating goods, assuming instead the
    existence of well-defined property rights enforced by an undefined third party.
    And yet even in ostensibly peaceful market transactions, conflict exists as an
    outside option, sometimes constraining the outcomes reached through voluntary
    agreement. In this volume, economists offer a crucial rational-choice
    perspective on conflict, using methodological approaches that range from the
    game theoretic to the experimental. Several chapters use the recently developed
    contest success function to model conflict, examining such topics as alliance
    formation, regional conflicts under fiscal federalism, coups d'etat in
    developing countries, and the correlation between conflict and economic growth
    in Bolivia. Other chapters consider subjects that include the link between
    occupational choices and antigovernment activity in Afghanistan, social unrest
    and the IMF's Structural Adjustment Program, and the effect of Tajikistan's
    civil war on ex-combatants' capacity for trust and cooperation. Taken together,
    these contributions show that economics needs a theory of conflict to
    understand both outright conflict and transactions in the shadow of conflict.
    But beyond this, they show that the study of conflict also needs the rigorous,
    methodology-based perspectives of economics. ContributorsVincenzo Bove, Raul

Here we expand and investigate the emerging notion of ``resilience'' as a perspective for understanding how societies can cope with, and develop from, disturbances and change. As the contributions to the special issue illustrate, resilience thinking in its current form contains substantial normative and conceptual difficulties for the analysis of social systems. However, a resilience approach to governance issues also shows a great deal of promise as it enables a more refined understanding of the dynamics of rapid, interlinked and multiscale change. This potential should not be underestimated as institutions and decision-makers try to deal with converging trends of global interconnectedness and increasing pressure on social-ecological systems. },

We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate. },

This article critiques the best of these efforts, looking at the way the ancient evidence has been handled and the conclusions drawn therefrom. It is argued that while the ancient world is an entirely appropriate era to investigate with regard to the issue, the analyses offered thus far have not made a strong case for the existence of a Greek democratic peace. Indeed, contrary to what investigators had hoped to show, the evidence from the period in and around the Peloponnesian war indicates that not only did ancient democracies go to war with each other, they did so with relatively high frequency. Both quantitative and more traditional literary analyses support this conclusion. These results do not so much attack the general notion of democratic peace as offer a more fruitful way of using ancient history to help explain it: by focusing on the differences between ancient and modern democracies and their historical settings, future studies may be able to identify the factors which encourage or discourage democratic peace.},

In considering the ‘resource curse,’ the types of natural resources matter. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ‘resource curse’ arising from the abundance of certain natural resources, particularly oil and forest resources, leads to increases in military spending. In contrast, the rent from coal and natural gas has a negative impact on military spending, while the rent from minerals has no impact on military spending, controlling for GDP growth and per capita income. },

We use a novel dataset from rural Burundi to examine the impact of local exposure to conflict on institutional quality, and try to ‘unbundle’ institutions by distinguishing between three dimensions of the institutional framework: property rights security, local political institutions, and social capital. We find that conflict exposure affects institutional quality, and document that the impact of conflict on institutional quality may be positive or negative, depending on the institutional measure. Specifically, exposure to violence strengthens in-group social capital and promotes tenure security. However, the appreciation for state institutions is negatively affected by exposure to violence. We find no evidence consistent with design-based theories of institutional quality, or the idea that institutional quality is enhanced by interventions of (non)state external actors. Instead our findings provide some support for the theory of parochial altruism. Our results emphasize the importance for policymakers to consider autonomous responses to conflict when designing development programs. They further imply some caution for actors seeking to reform local institutions through top-down interventions.},

Using a model of the evolutionary impact of between-group competition and a new data set that combines archaeological evidence on causes of death during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene with ethnographic and historical reports on hunter-gatherer populations, I find that the estimated level of mortality in intergroup conflicts would have had substantial effects, allowing the proliferation of group-beneficial behaviors that were quite costly to the individual altruist.},

    abstract   = { A pivotal characteristic of credit defaults that is ignored by most credit scoring models is the rarity of the event. The most widely used model to estimate the probability of default is the logistic regression model. Since the dependent variable represents a rare event, the logistic regression model shows relevant drawbacks, for example, underestimation of the default probability, which could be very risky for banks. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we propose the generalized extreme value regression model. In particular, in a generalized linear model (GLM) with the binary-dependent variable we suggest the quantile function of the GEV distribution as link function, so our attention is focused on the tail of the response curve for values close to one. The estimation procedure used is the maximum-likelihood method. This model accommodates skewness and it presents a generalisation of GLMs with complementary log–log link function. We analyse its performance by simulation studies. Finally, we apply the proposed model to empirical data on Italian small and medium enterprises. },

The paper focuses on three sets of positive models: First, it explores self-enforcing federalism; that is, how federal systems are held together given various tendencies for federal systems to become centralized or fall apart. Second, it considers how specific political institutions, such as democracy, interact with decentralization. Finally, it studies various political impediments to economic growth, again highlighting the interaction with decentralization. },

  abstract    = {The U.S. Federalism has been concerned with how to best place functions and instruments in a decentralized system. Based on the highlights in the fiscal federalism literatures, this dissertation addresses three issues by focusing on two fiscal instruments in county governments – local sales tax and intergovernmental grants. First, this dissertation examines the determinants of local sales tax adoption and rates considering both the internal condition of local heterogeneity and the external condition of fiscal interaction. The empirical examinations of the determinants provide strong evidence that fiscal interaction is important to the decision to adopt local sales tax and to set local sales tax rate. Moreover, the political conflicts of interests between the actors of representatives and voters-taxpayers are observed in the adoption and rate setting. Second, this dissertation examines the interactions between the two fiscal instruments that have different purposes. Assuming that local sales taxes are local authority and power, and that intergovernmental grants are the upper-level support for and control to the lower-level, this dissertation finds that the two fiscal instruments have reverse relationships. Third, this dissertation examines the budgetary effects of the two fiscal instruments on property tax burdens, revenues, and own-source revenues in county governments. Both fiscal instruments are empirically shown to increase local revenues, while only local sales taxes statistically expand local own-source revenues. Moreover, local sales taxes reduce property tax burdens, while intergovernmental grants raise the burdens. Unlike the existing literatures that focus on local jurisdictions within states, another contribution of this dissertation is a large data set that covers all U.S. county governments for a long-period. However, the empirical examinations clarify limitations that intra-jurisdictional competition matters in U.S. fiscal federalism. The contributions and limitations provide the foundation the future research that will handle intra-jurisdictional competition, and better tackle the details of fiscal federalism.},

This paper studies what affects the volatility of sub-central public spending in 20 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. The evidence based on data from 1972 to 2007 shows that the volatility of intergovernmental grants from upper levels is positively associated with the volatility of local expenditure. On the other hand, the volatility of local tax revenues – mainly that of property taxes – exerts the opposite effect. These findings suggest that making local governments rely more on grants than own tax revenues adversely affects their spending stability. Allowing them to levy autonomously taxes relying on responsive tax bases provides incentives to smooth their expenditure.},

During the Archaic period (800–500 BCE), many Greek poleis (city-states) replaced aristocracies with a more narrow governing institution—an autocrat known as the tyrant. Yet as classical scholars have noted, many of the poleis where tyrants reigned in the Archaic period became among the broadest democracies in the subsequent Classical period (500–323 BCE). We analyze a data set of ancient Greek political regime types and review the history of the best-known Archaic period tyrants in order to explore why a transitory narrowing of power—Greek tyranny was a transitory institution—can set the stage for democratization. We briefly consider other historical and modern examples. Our paper shows why an understanding of progress toward democracy requires recognizing the potential importance of nonmonotonic transition paths.},

Although they could not vote, Spartan women reportedly owned 40 percent of Sparta's agricultural land, and enjoyed other rights that were equally extraordinary. We offer a simple economic explanation for the Spartan anomaly. The defining moment for Sparta was its conquest of a neighboring land and people, which fundamentally changed the marginal products of Spartan men's and Spartan women's labor. To exploit the potential gains from a reallocation of labor---specifically, to provide the appropriate incentives and the proper human capital formation---men granted women property (and other) rights. Consistent with our explanation for the rise of women's rights, when Sparta lost the conquered land several centuries later, the rights for women disappeared. Two conclusions emerge that may help explain why women's rights have been so rare for most of history. First, in contrast to the historical norm, the optimal (from the men's perspective) division of labor among Spartans involved women in work that was not easily monitored by men. Second, the rights held by Spartan women may have been part of an unstable equilibrium, which contained the seeds of its own destruction.},

    abstract   = {We argue that the regional threat environment a state faces plays a consequential role in its political development and the likelihood of experiencing future intrastate wars. Challenges to a state’s territorial integrity lead governments to increase their military personnel, and the resources that support these increases most often come willingly from a public that seeks security. Territorial threats are unlike other types of threats because they challenge individual lives and livelihoods, which both connects the average citizen with the state and allows for easier government extraction of necessary resources. Thus, external territorial threats increase state capacity by unifying the state and by increasing the repressive power of the central government. We identify territorial threats as both latent and realized claims against state territories and find that the presence of an external threat to territory leads to an increase in the capacity of central governments to connect and extract from its citizens, as well as the capacity to repress potential regime dissidents. We also find that the presence of a claim against a state’s territory from a neighbor corresponds with a substantial decrease in the likelihood of intrastate conflict at both high and low levels of intensity. The effect of territorial threat is observed even in the short term after a territorial threat has been resolved. Our tests, using standard models of state capacity and insurgency models of conflict on a sample of all states from 1946 to 2007, are robust to multiple model specifications.},

    abstract   = {Constitutional resolution of disputes between constituent groups of a polity avoids the incremental costs of civil conflict. But, the political process prescribed by a constitution provides a viable alternative to civil conflict only if the constitution is self-enforcing. Theoretical analysis reveals that the following properties help to make it possible to design a self-enforcing constitution that can settle recurring disputes:
      • No party to the disputes has a big advantage in civil conflict.
      • The parties to the disputes expect the incremental costs of civil conflict to be large relative to the importance of the disputes that arise between them.
      • The parties are greatly concerned about the future consequences of their current actions.
      
         Theoretical analysis also reveals that a self-enforcing constitution can require limitations on the prerogatives of winners of constitutional contests such that on average outcomes under the constitution are not too favorable to any one party and such that the outcome of each constitutional contest does not matter too much. The paper concludes with historical examples that illustrate the broad applicability of the theoretical analysis.

When this is taken account of the long-run favors not a large population at the level of subsistence, nor yet institutions that maximize welfare or per capita output, but rather institutions that generate large amount of free resources and direct these towards state power. Free resources are the output available to society after deducting the payments necessary for subsistence and for the incentives needed to induce production, and the other claims to production such as transfer payments and resources absorbed by elites. We develop the evolutionary underpinnings of this model, and examine the implications for the evolution of societies in several applications. Since free resources are increasing both in per capita income and population, evolution will favor large rich societies. We will show how technological improvement can increase or decrease per capita output as well as increasing population. },

In the absence of direct group-level interactions, groups with the most cooperative members will outcompete less cooperative groups, while within any group the least cooperative members will be the most successful. Introducing group-level interactions, however, such as raiding or warfare, changes the selective landscape for groups. Our model suggests that as the global population becomes more integrated and the rate of intergroup conflict increases, selection increasingly favors unequally distributed power structures, where individual influence is weighted by acquired resources. The advantage to less democratic groups rests in their ability to facilitate selection for cooperative strategies – involving cooperation both among themselves and with outsiders – in order to produce the resources necessary to fuel their success in inter-group conflicts, while simultaneously selecting for leaders (and corresponding collective behavior) who are unburdened with those same prosocial norms. The coevolution of cooperative social norms and institutions of power facilitates the emergence of a leadership class of the selfish and has implications for theories of inequality, structures of governance, non-cooperative personality traits, and hierarchy. Our findings suggest an amendment to the well-known doctrine of multilevel selection that “Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups.” In an interconnected world, altruistic groups led by selfish individuals can beat them both. },

Leaders who reorganize power around their position seem inimical to most individuals’ welfare. Yet in many countries these leaders receive broad popular support when citizens feel some type of threat. This study argues that territorial threat leads individuals to support this type of state leadership. Mobilization of the military for defense of territory requires discretion by the state leader, leading individuals to interpret checks and balances as obstacles to security. The results using mixed effects logit analyses show a robust connection between territorial threat and individual-level expectations of the state leader. Individuals who live in states under territorial threat are more likely to prefer a state leader unconstrained by legislative process or other checks and balances. The analyses provided in this study have important implications for the study of popular support of democracy.},

Under majority rule, the equilibrium tax share balances the budget and pays for the voters' choices. The principal reasons for increased size of government implied by the model are extensions of the franchise that change the position of the decisive voter in the income distribution and changes in relative productivity.

We examine two  institutional variables: size of the selectorate (S) – the set of people who have an institutional say  in choosing leaders – and the size of the winning coalition (W) – the minimal set of people whose  support the incumbent needs in order to remain in power. The larger the winning coalition, the  greater the emphasis leaders place on effective public policy. When W is small, leaders focus on  providing private goods to their small group of supporters at the expense of the provision of public  goods. The size of the selectorate influences how hard leaders work on behalf of their supporters.  The greater the size of the selectorate, the more current supporters fear exclusion from future  coalitions. This induces a norm of loyalty that enables leaders to reduce their effort and still  survive. As a first step towards a theory of endogenous selection of institutions, we characterize  the institutional preferences of the different segments of society based on the consequences of  these institutions for individual welfare. We conclude by examining the implication of the model  for the tenure of leaders, public policy, economic growth, corruption, taxation and ethnic politics. },

Leaders compete sequentially and are constrained by the threat of entry, their ability to tax, or both, so that a dictator with no challengers may nonetheless implement policies in the public interest. By focusing on the incentives for political entry, our model helps to classify regimes and to clarify some of the political science debate as to whether political monopoly power is properly measured by the size of political entry barriers or the frequency of leadership turnover. Moreover, we offer economic interpretations of why some dictatorial regimes are uncontested, why there are good and bad dictators, why nondemocratic countries are associated with lower wages, why resource abundant countries tend to be nondemocratic, and how technological change affects political development. Finally, we show how external support of opposition political parties and other policies designed to promote democracy may actually have the unintended consequences of discouraging political competition. },

The model emphasizes the role of political entry and deadweight costs of taxation on the joint determination of these economic and political outcomes. Contrary to popular belief, my model shows that natural resource abundance is an economic blessing even in a rent-seeking society, although resource dependence can be negatively associated with economic performance. In a contested political market, dictators care about popular support and hence resource wealth can help reduce the deadweight cost of taxation (and hence the cost of public good provision). On the other hand, natural resource wealth can be a political curse, because it encourages political entry and hence it induces incumbent dictators to run more repressive regimes. With constant returns counterinsurgent technology, however, the equilibrium number of insurgents is independent of the size of resource wealth. The onset of civil war, therefore, depends on the counterinsurgent technology and whether the costs of entry deterrence are affected by resource wealth. This helps clarify the two seemingly contradictory hypotheses that “resource wealth enhances regime durability” and “resource wealth fuels conflict.”},

This article aims to resolve this controversy by developing new settlement pattern indicators based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data. Using conflict data at the level of ethnic groups, I show that there is clear evidence in favor of the opportunity mechanism.

Different social groups prefer different political institutions because of the way they allocate political power and resources. Thus democracy is preferred by the majority of citizens, but opposed by elites. Dictatorship nevertheless is not stable when citizens can threaten social disorder and revolution. In response, when the costs of repression are sufficiently high and promises of concessions are not credible, elites may be forced to create democracy. By democratizing, elites credibly transfer political power to the citizens, ensuring social stability. Democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentive to overthrow it. These processes depend on (1) the strength of civil society, (2) the structure of political institutions, (3) the nature of political and economic crises, (4) the level of economic inequality, (5) the structure of the economy, and (6) the form and extent of globalization.},

	Abstract = {Building on a growing literature in international political science, I reexamine the traditional liberal claim that governments founded on a respect for individual liberty exercise "restraint" and "peaceful intentions" in their foreign policy. I look at three distinct theoretical traditions of liberalism, attributable to three theorists: Schumpeter, a democratic capitalist whose explanation of liberal pacifism we often invoke; Machiavelli, a classical republican whose glory is an imperialism we often practice; and Kant, a liberal republican whose theory of internationalism best accounts for what we are. Despite the contradictions of liberal pacifism and liberal imperialism, I find, with Kant and other democratic republicans, that liberalism does leave a coherent legacy on foreign affairs. Liberal states are different. They are indeed peaceful. They are also prone to make war. Liberal states have created a separated peace as Kant argued they would, and have also discovered liberal reasons for aggression, as he feared they might. I conclude by arguing that the differences among liberal pacifism, liberal imperialism, and Kant's internationalism are not arbitrary. They are rooted in differing conceptions of the citizen and the state.},

This dataset provides details of the geographic location of Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) onsets between 1816 and 2001. These data on locations are available at both the dispute-level (for 1816—2001) and the incident-level (for 1993—2001). This article briefly identifies the motivation behind this data-collection project, details some of the coding procedures followed in assembling the MIDLOC dataset, and then offers some mapped visualizations of the variance in this dataset across time. These maps are designed, in part, to stimulate additional hypothesis derivation in work on the geography of conflict. The data are then employed to offer a geographic assessment of the proposition that democracies tend to conduct the majority of their conflicts on their opponents’ territories. The article then concludes with a discussion of some additional potential applications of the MIDLOC dataset.},

This article surveys the statistical challenges to the democratic peace and critically analyzes a prominent recent critique (Gartzke 2007). Gartzke's claim that capitalist dynamics explain away the democratic peace relies on results problematically driven by (1) the censoring from the sample of observations containing certain communist countries or occurring before 1966, (2) the inclusion of regional controls, and (3) a misspecification of temporal controls. Analysis of these issues contributes to broader methodological debates and reveals novel characteristics of the democratic peace. Gartzke and other critics have contributed valuably to the study of IR; however, the democratic peace remains one of the most robust empirical associations in IR.},

These studies rescind the primary evidence for democracy being a cause of the democratic peace and indicate that contract-intensive economy is the more likely explanation for it. This article addresses all recent defenses of the democratic peace correlation, reports results using a new measure of contract flows, and extends the investigation to all militarized interstate conflicts. Analyses of most nations from 1961 to 2001 show that there is no correlation of democracy with peace, and contract-intensive economy is one of the most powerful nontrivial variables in international conflict. The era of the democratic peace appears to be at an end, sub},

@article{Gartzke98,
	Abstract = {Theory: Current theories of the democratic peace focus on the constraining power of political institutions, culture, or international trade. If instead democracies are much less likely to disagree about each other's policies, then we would expect them to seldom fight regardless of whether they are constrained from acting on conflicts by institutions, culture, or other factors. While previous research on the democratic peace has been careful to construct statistical models of "opportunity"-the physical obstacles nations face in engaging in war-research to date has failed to incorporate "willingness"-the psychological incentives nations have to overcome obstacles in pursuit of their objectives. Hypothesis: I argue that a satisfactory assessment of the democratic peace requires controlling for willingness as well as opportunity. A measure of the affinity nations have for each other's international policy should correlate with observations of the democratic peace. Methods: I present a statistical model of national preference using data from the United Nations General Assembly 1950-85 to assess whether joint democracy still accounts for the democratic peace. I test the model using logistic regression and by replicating recent quantitative studies of the democratic peace. Results: Results support the argument that national preferences account for the lack of conflict between democracies.},

@article{Dixon94,
	Abstract = {The research reported here develops an explanation for the often-noted absence of international war between democratic states. This explanation is derived from a theoretical rationale centered on universal democratic norms for reconciling competing values and interests. I argue that democratic states locked in disputes are better equipped than others with the means for diffusing conflict situations at an early stage before they have an opportunity to escalate to military violence. Not only is this explanatory logic consistent with the published findings on democracy and war, but it also entails the novel empirical proposition that disputes between democracies are more amenable than are other disputes to peaceful settlements, the hypothesis I examine here. Analyses of contemporary interstate disputes reveal that even when potentially confounding factors are controlled, democratic opponents are significantly more likely to reach peaceful settlements than other types of disputants.},

	Abstract = {Democratic states are in general about as conflict- and war-prone as nondemocracies, but democracies have rarely clashed with one another in violent conflict. We first show that democracy, as well as other factors, accounts for the relative lack of conflict. Then we examine two explanatory models. The normative model suggests that democracies do not fight each other because norms of compromise and cooperation prevent their conflicts of interest from escalating into violent clashes. The structural model asserts that complex political mobilization processes impose institutional constraints on the leaders of two democracies confronting each other to make violent conflict unfeasible. Using different data sets of international conflict and a multiplicity of indicators, we find that (1) democracy, in and of itself, has a consistent and robust negative effect on the likelihood of conflict or escalation in a dyad; (2) both the normative and structural models are supported by the data; and (3) support for the normative model is more robust and consistent.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical arguments and some empirical evidence suggest that war is more likely to occur between states that are geographically proximate, approximately equal in power, major powers, allied, undemocratic, economically advanced, and highly militarized than between those that are not. Bivariate analyses of these seven factors in relation to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of states in the period from 1816 to 1965 generally support these associations. However, multivariate analyses reveal some differences. In order of declining importance, the conditions that characterize a dangerous, war-prone dyad are: presence of contiguity, absence of alliance, absence of more advanced economy, absence of democratic polity, absence of overwhelming preponderance, and presence of major power. Taken together these findings suggest that our research priorities may be seriously distorted and that the idealist prescription for peace may be better than the realist one.},

 abstract = {The relationship between static and dynamic power distributions and war is a central element in the realist literature of international politics. The distribution of power and shifts in these distributions are held to be a principal source of conflict in works from Thucydides to Waltz. Most attempts to test empirically for a structural association between capability distributions and conflict have treated disputes as independent events; however, over the last two centuries a disproportionate amount of interstate conflict has occurred in the context of extended dyadic rivalries. This study focuses on the conflict patterns of these "enduring rivals." Based on a Markov chain analysis of 456 militarized disputes occurring between 1816 and 1986, the findings indicate that power parity and shifts toward parity are approximately twice as likely to be associated with war as is a condition of power preponderance. By definition, rival dyads have issues in conflict. Equality of power or shifts toward equality create a situation in which both sides can perceive the potential for successful use of force. The findings generated in this analysis indicate that with such power distributions war between rival nations is most probable.},

    abstract   = {Recent scholarship suggests that democracies tend to fight shorter conflicts that can be easily won. This is most likely due to the accountability incentives that constrain democratic leaders. Fearing removal from office, democratic leaders will try to choose short conflicts against weaker opponents. The authors question this argument by presenting an alternative explanation for the connection between democracy and shorter disputes and victories. Building on prior works that have identified a territorial peace, this article argues that democracies often have few territorial issues over which to contend. In fact, rarely do democracies have territorial disputes with their neighbors. Thus, democracies have less difficult issues to resolve, and this makes conflict escalation less likely against neighbors. Without neighbors ready to attack the homeland, states at territorial peace can more easily choose favorable conflicts to escalate. This logic applies to all states at territorial peace, of which democratic states are just a subset. Analyses of directed-dispute dyads between 1816 and 2001 provide confirmation for our argument. Regime type does not predict conflict selection or victory once controls are added for issue salience.},

Using a drought index to proxy for weather shocks, we find that a one-standard-deviation fall in the index (signaling drier conditions) raises the likelihood of riots in a given cell and month by 8.3%. We further observe that the effect of unusually dry weather conditions is substantially larger in cells with a lower availability of water resources (such as rivers and lakes), a finding that supports the significance of the competition-for-water mechanism.},

Quantitatively, our estimates suggest that the historical rise in mineral prices (commodity super-cycle) might explain up to one-fourth of the average level of violence across African countries over the period. We then document how a fighting group's control of a mining area contributes to escalation from local to global violence. Finally, we analyze the impact of corporate practices and transparency initiatives in the mining industry.},

We demonstrate that democratic leaders, when faced with war, are more inclined to shift extra resources into the war effort than are autocrats. This follows because the survival of political leaders with larger winning coalitions hinges on successful policy. The extra effort made by democrats provides a military advantage over autocrats. This makes democrats unattractive targets, since their institutional constraints cause them to mobilize resources for the war effort. In addition to trying harder, democrats are more selective in their choice of targets. Because defeat is more likely to lead to domestic replacement for democrats than for autocrats, democrats only initiate wars they expect to win. These two factors lead to the interaction between polities that is often referred to as the democratic peace.},

However, it seems natural that individuals hesitate toimitate their neighbor's acts, specially if they can imply high costs. Here we study the effect of incorporating resistance to imitation on these models. Our framework is the spatial Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma. For this evolutionary game, it has been reported that occasional errors in the imitation process can explain the emergence ofcooperation from a non-cooperative initial state. In this work, weshow that this only occurs for particular regimes of low costs of cooperation. Furthermore, we display how resistance gets greater the range of scenarios where cooperative individuals can invade selfish populations. In this context, where resistance to imitation can be interpreted as a general rule of gradual learning, our results show that the less that is learnt in a single step from a successful neighbors, the larger the degree of global cooperation finally attained. In general, the effect of step-by-step learning can be more efficient for the evolution of cooperation than a full blast one.},

We compare interaction neighbourhoods of different size and structure, we observe choices under different information conditions, and we estimate parameters of a learning model. We find that naive imitation, although a driving force in many models of spatial evolution, may be negligible in the experiment. Naive imitation predicts more cooperation in spatial structures than in spaceless ones—regardless whether interaction neighbourhoods have the same or different sizes in both structures. We find that with some interaction neighbourhoods even the opposite may hold."

Spatio-temporal capital dynamics are described by a parabolic partial differential equation. The application of the maximum principle leads to necessary but non-sufficient first-order conditions. Thanks to the linearity of the production technology and the special spatial setting considered, the value function of the problem is found explicitly, and the (unique) optimal control is identified in feedback form. Despite constant returns to capital, we prove that the spatio-temporal dynamics, induced by the willingness of the planner to give the same (detrended) consumption over space and time, lead to convergence in the level of capital across locations in the long-run."

This higher productivity may occur because more talented individuals sort into large cities, because large cities select more productive entrepreneurs and firms, or because of agglomeration economies. We develop a model of systems of cities that combines all three elements and suggests interesting complementarities between them. The model can replicate stylized facts about sorting, agglomeration, and selection in cities. It also generates Zipf’s law for cities under empirically plausible parameter values. Finally, it provides a useful framework within which to reinterpret extant empirical evidence. }

Recently substantial theoretical progress has been made using three different approaches. These are the Marshallian approach, where economies of scale are assumed external to firms; the Chamberlinian approach, where imperfect competition takes the relatively tractable form of monopolistic competition; and the Cournot approach of noncooperative quantity-setting firms. This paper surveys the basic concepts and results of each approach. It shows that some basic insights are not too sensitive to the particular model of market structure. Although much remains to be done, we have made more progress toward a general analysis of increasing returns and trade than anyone would have thought possible even a few years ago.},

In order to realize scale economies while minimizing transport costs, manufacturing firms tend to locate in the region with larger demand, but the location of demand itself depends on the distribution of manufacturing. Emergence of a core-periphery pattern depends on transportation costs, economies of scale, and the share of manufacturing in national income. }

 abstract = {Past explanations of violence have characteristically paid more attention to the issues of social conditions and psychocultural stimuli than to the issue of timing. Timing is the focus of this paper in which a differential equation model of the temporal diffusion of violence is developed. This model is derived from behavioral generalizations which indicate that aggression is both instigated and inhibited via direct and vicarious learning. The parameters of the model provide measures of the instigation and inhibition processes that take place throughout an outbreak. Twenty-five data sets representing a wide variety of collective outbreaks of violence are used to test the empirical fit and to evaluate the credibility of the assumptions of the model. The model describes the overtime distribution of incidents quite accurately and the assumptions and implications of the derivation appear to be consistent with the cultural conditions surrounding the outbreaks.},

This paper takes a different approach and analyzes how violence in civil wars spreads in space and time, drawing on earlier work on micro-diffusion of violence in criminology as well as high resolution conflict data. Two general scenarios are distinguished in our analysis: the relocation and the escalation of conflict. Relocation diffusion corresponds to a shift in the location of violence, whereas escalation diffusion refers to the spatial expansion of the conflict site. We argue that unconventional warfare in civil wars without demarcated front lines should primarily lead to the second type of pattern. We describe an extension to a joint count statistic to measure both diffusion types in conflict event data. Monte Carlo simulation allows for the establishment of a baseline for the frequency of contiguous conflict events under the assumption of independence, and thus provides a significance test for the observed patterns. Our results suggest that violence in civil wars exhibits patterns of diffusion, and in particular, that these patterns are primarily of the escalation type, driven by the dynamic expansion of the scope of the conflict."}

 abstract = {The discussion reports the results of an examination of the possible diffusion of new war participations during the 1946-65 era. A theoretical argument is developed to yield more precise expectations about when, where, why, and how diffusion processs might operate. Four diffusion-related processes (positive spatial diffusion, positive reinforcement, negative spatial diffusion, and negative reinforcement) are discussed and analyzed. A series of simple turnover tables and a focus on nations' borders are used to go beyond the authors' previous stochastic modeling efforts. The results provide strong evidence that is consistent with both the authors' theoretical argument and the general war diffusion hypothesis. The analyses seem to indicate that certain types of wars may indeed have tended to diffuse across space from one nation to another between 1946 and 1965.},

By dividing the players into influential and non-influential ones, we can discuss the impact of individual diversity on the cooperative behaviors. Meanwhile, we implement the utility interdependency by integrating the payoff correlations between two lattices. Extensive simulations indicate that the optimal density of influential players exists for the cooperation to be promoted, and can be further facilitated through the utility coupling. Current results are beneficial to understanding the origin of cooperation among selfish agents among realistic scenarios."

abstract = "Abstract We investigate the incidence of early warfare among foragers and farmers in prehistory. Our focus is specifically on conflict over land. Food is produced using inputs of labor and land, and the probability of victory in a conflict depends on relative group sizes. The group sizes are determined by individual migration and Malthusian population dynamics. Both factors result in larger populations at better sites, which deters attack. There are two necessary conditions for warfare: high enough individual mobility costs and large enough shocks to the relative productivities of the sites. Together, these conditions are sufficient. In particular, technological or environmental shocks that alter the productivities of sites can trigger warfare, but only if individual agents do not change sites in response. These results are consistent with evidence from archaeology and anthropology."

abstract = { In international relations, unlike the natural sciences, there are few fundamental principles or laws. The world map, however, reveals at least one iron law of global politics: human territoriality. Almost every inch of the globe is partitioned into exclusive and bounded spaces that “belong” to specific groups of humans. Any that is not—such as Kashmir, Jerusalem, and the South China Sea—remains hotly contested. Throughout history, territory has led to recurrent and severe conflict. States are prepared to go to war, and individuals are prepared to die, even over land with little intrinsic value. While such behavior presents a puzzle for international relations theory, a broader evolutionary perspective reveals that territorial behavior has the following three characteristics: (1) it is common across the animal kingdom, suggesting a convergent solution to a common strategic problem; (2) it is a dominant strategy in the “hawk-dove” game of evolutionary game theory (under certain well-defined conditions); and (3) it follows a strategic logic, but one calibrated to cost-benefit ratios that prevailed in our evolutionary past, not those of the present. These insights generate novel predictions about when territorial conflict is more or less likely to occur in international relations. }

Tenure regimes are the result of interactions between those seeking to defend claims to land and those seeking to infringe on those claims. The model highlights the dependence of land ownership on ecological parameters, such as resource density and predictability, and allows for situational ownership, in which the nature of ownership changes as realized ecological conditions change. The paper concludes with a comparative assessment of tenure across a representative sample of hunter‐gatherer peoples.},

Procedures are developed to deal with the logistical problems inherent in experiments involving many subjects. Data from Voluntary Contribution Mechanism experiments are reported utilizing group sizes of 4, 10, 40 and 100. THese experiments provide replicable results that contradict the widely held view that a group's ability to provide the optimal level of a pure public good is inversely related to group size. On the contrary, groups of size 40 and 100 provided the public good more efficiently than groups of size 4 and 10. Several possible alternative explanations are discussed."

They are used widely in many areas of economics that employ contest games, from tournaments and rent-seeking to conflict and sports. We first examine the theoretical foundations of contest functions and classify them into four types of derivation: stochastic, axiomatic, optimally-derived, and microfounded. The additive form (which includes the ratio or “Tullock” functional form) can be derived in all four different ways. We also explore issues in the econometric estimation of contest functions, including concerns with data, endogeneity, and model comparison."

The OLS estimates of the Pareto exponent are roughly normally distributed, but those of the Hill estimator are bimodal. Variations in the value of the Pareto exponent are better explained by political economy variables than by economic geography variables."

We then use micro-level trade data to quantify the implications of this new formula. Our main finding is that gains from trade liberalization predicted by models with variable markups are slightly lower than those predicted by models with constant markups. In this sense, pro-competitive effects of trade are elusive.},

We focus on pure-coordination games played by agents located on one-dimensional lattices and we assume that network externalities become eventually negative as neighborhood sizes increase. We show that the society almost always converges to a steady-state characterized by high levels of coordination and small neighborhood sizes. We find that neighborhood adjustment allows for higher coordination than if interaction structures were static and that large populations attain higher coordination provided that average initial neighborhood sizes are not too small."

We show that both absolute and relative endowments matter for the pattern of trade. We demonstrate that market entry to each industry is either too excessive or too moderate while the effect on firm size is ambiguous. If countries are sufficiently symmetric, trade will increase the wage–rental ratio in both countries. Furthermore, trade will increase per-capita consumption in capital-intensive industries and reduce it in labor-intensive industries. Nevertheless, trade will be mutually welfare-improving under relatively mild conditions."

abstract = {This paper presents a new model of oligopoly in general equilibrium and explores its implications for positive and normative aspects of international trade. Assuming “continuum–Pollak” preferences, the model allows for consistent aggregation over a continuum of sectors, in each of which a small number of home and foreign firms engage in Cournot competition. I show how competitive advantage interacts with comparative advantage to determine resource allocation and, specializing to continuum–quadratic preferences, I explore the model's implications for the gains from trade, for the distribution of income between wages and profits, and for production and trade patterns in a two-country world.}

These environments have been studied using Tullock contests, all-pay auctions and rank-order tournaments. This survey provides a comprehensive review of experimental research on these three canonical contests. First, we review studies investigating the basic structure of contests, including the number of players and prizes, spillovers and externalities, heterogeneity, risk and incomplete information. Second, we discuss dynamic contests and multi-battle contests. Then we review studies examining sabotage, feedback, bias, collusion, alliances, group contests and gender, as well as field experiments. Finally, we discuss applications of contests and suggest directions for future research.},

Strategically equivalent contests generate the same best response functions and, as a result, the same equilibrium efforts. However, strategically equivalent contests may yield different equilibrium payoffs. We propose a simple two-step procedure to identify strategically equivalent contests. Using this procedure, we identify contests that are strategically equivalent to the original Tullock contest, and provide new examples of strategically equivalent contests. Finally, we discuss possible contest design applications and avenues for future theoretical and empirical research.},

 abstract = {A constrained n-person game is considered in which the constraints for each player, as well as his payoff function, may depend on the strategy of every player. The existence of an equilibrium point for such a game is shown. By requiring appropriate concavity in the payoff functions a concave game is defined. It is proved that there is a unique equilibrium point for every strictly concave game. A dynamic model for nonequilibrium situations is proposed. This model consists of a system of differential equations which specify the rate of change of each player's strategy. It is shown that for a strictly concave game the system is globally asymptotically stable with respect to the unique equilibrium point of the game. Finally, it is shown how a gradient method suitable for a concave mathematical programming problem can be used to find the equilibrium point for a concave game.},

We show that this gives rise to a new mechanism by which a cartel can sustain a collusive agreement: Collusion at the extensive margin whereby firms collude by avoiding entry into each other's markets or territories. We characterise parameter values that sustain this type of collusion and identify the assumptions where this collusion is more likely to hold than its intensive margin counterpart. Specifically, it is demonstrated that where duopoly competition is fierce collusion at the extensive margin is always sustainable. Finally, we provide a theoretic foundation for the use of a “proportional response” enforcement mechanism.},

We compare the deviations of optimal from actual firm behavior across industries categorized by their ratios of idiosyncratic uncertainty to the sum of idiosyncratic and aggregate uncertainty. The deviations are represented by the residuals of a cointegrating regression that is derived from the firm's first-order condition under no adjustment costs. In support of models with asynchronous firm decisions, we find a significant negative relationship across industries between idiosyncratic uncertainty and the persistence of these residuals. }

In a first step, we develop a multi-region multi-industry economic geography model under Cournot competition, of which we estimate the parameter values from French data. We then turn to simulations to see whether a core–periphery equilibrium exists, even with strategic interactions among firms. We show that the marginal profits and mark-ups of firms are greater in both core and peripheral regions than in between, due to a subtle interplay between competition and market-access forces. Production is mostly monocentric, however, and profits are higher in the core, which should produce further concentration. We finally show that policy-makers face a difficult trade-off: lowering inter-regional trade costs reduces disparities between regions, but increases intra-regional inequality.},

This implicitly assumes a criterion that tests beliefs against the observed outcomes generated by the model. We formalize this requirement in stationary environments. We show that there is a tension between requiring that beliefs can be tested against systematic errors and allowing agents to disagree or be uncertain about the long-run fundamentals. We discuss the application of our analysis to asset pricing, Markov perfect equilibria, and dynamic games. }

  abstract = {This paper assesses the effect of fiscal decentralization on government consumption volatility using data for 97 developed and developing countries from 1971 to 2010. The results suggest that a higher degree of fiscal decentralization leads to lower government consumption volatility. This result holds for the sub-sample of advanced economies, while it is not confirmed for those less-developed. This mechanism seems to work mainly through a lower volatility of the non-discretionary spending, which typically belongs to the central government's policy. We also confirm existing findings according to which country size lowers government spending volatility. Thus, given a minimum level of development, fiscal decentralization reforms can reduce spending volatility by distributing power to sub-central governments, particularly in smaller countries which are usually more prone to volatility.},
